        These cards aim to prompt conversations with a deeper meaning and depth of connection in social scenes. 
        You are free to play it however you want, altering it depending on the vibe, like UNO! It could even include a penalisation for not responding. However, we recommend playing it in the following way:
        <ol>
            <li>Draw a card</li>
            <li>Read it out loud</li>
            <li>Everyone has to answer it (go as deep as you want)</li>
            <li>Repeat</li>
        </ol>
